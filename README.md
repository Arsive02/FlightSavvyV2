![FlightSavvy Logo](https://i.ibb.co/nqyz2sb1/budget-small.png)

FlightSavvy is an advanced flight price prediction application that leverages machine learning algorithms to help travelers find the optimal time to book flights, saving money and reducing travel planning stress.

## üöÄ Features

- **Price Navigator**: Advanced AI analysis to find the optimal booking time for any route
- **Interactive Flight Assistant**: Conversational AI to answer flight-related questions and provide personalized recommendations
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: View price trends across different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- **Airline Comparison**: Compare pricing patterns across different carriers
- **Visual Analytics**: Interactive charts and visualizations of flight price trends
- **Student Discounts**: Special pricing information for students and other passenger types

## üíª Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React** with TypeScript for a robust UI experience
- **Recharts** for interactive data visualization
- **CSS** with custom "Cockpit Theme" for an immersive aviation-inspired interface

### Backend
- **Python** with Flask for the API server
- **Machine Learning** models for price prediction:
  - Random Forest for pattern recognition
  - Time Series analysis for seasonal trends

### AI Integration
- Conversational AI assistant for natural language flight queries
- Watson Assistant integration for advanced chatbot capabilities

## üß† How It Works

FlightSavvy uses a combination of historical flight data analysis and machine learning models to predict future flight prices. The system considers:

1. **Route Factors**: Distance, competition, popularity
2. **Temporal Patterns**: Seasonal trends, day-of-week effects, holiday periods
3. **Carrier Variables**: Different pricing strategies by airline
4. **Market Dynamics**: Supply and demand fluctuations

The machine learning pipeline includes:
- Feature engineering to extract relevant patterns
- Random Forest model for complex pattern recognition
- Time series analysis for trend identification
- Ensemble approach for improved prediction accuracy
